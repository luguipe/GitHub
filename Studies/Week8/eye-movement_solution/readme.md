Hey there, 

Title: **Eye-Movement Project**

This is the ReadMe for the Eye-Movement, here you will see a basic js implementation where the eyes will follow the movementes of your mouse, nothing fancing, just another/function tool to use when developing webpages.

**RoadMap**: At the moment this is a final implementation and there is no fuure improvements, again, tht is the plan for now but that can change at anytime, is just a mather of needing to improve something, than, new animations can be included.
