#### This is the README for Luiz Perez REPO

Hi There, If you get to here,  you probably  want to know what I've being doing with my time, so, here it is, these folders contains every line of code that I worked since i started my journey at **MIT - Full Stack Developement with MERN** its a be disorganized but the folders title usually refers to what you will see inside, I'm including more readme's files but that will take some time since I must focus at the content of the course, for more information you can contact in these options below.
